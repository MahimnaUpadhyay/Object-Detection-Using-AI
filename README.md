# Object-Detection-Using-AI:- 
Hello Everyone :), I hope you are doing great. I have made a one **Stop Sign Detection** project with the help of **OpenCV**. The project is pretty simple, I have taken data for **Stop Sign** in **XML** format. 
Using that data, I have created two Python files:- 
1. Object-Detection-Using-Image
2. Object-Detection-Using-Webcam

   

# 1. Object-Detection-Using-Image:- 
In this Python file, I am just performing a simple logic in which I am talking **STOP SIGN** jpg image and storing it into one variable i.e. **image**. And using XML data, I used OpenCV methods to read **XML data**
and converting image colour to **grayscale** and **RGB** to understand it better, and showing a message that says "**This is Stop Sign**".

# 2. Object-Detection-Using-Webcam:-
In this Python file, I am using **OpenCV** **VideoCapture method** to use my system default camera to take a real-time feed. Using the same data from before I was able to detect **Stop Sign** using my system Camera.
I have added one more functionality to this program, I have added **Text to Speech** functionality, which will help a lot of users whose eyesight is weak.
